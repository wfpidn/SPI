# Satellite-based monitoring of dry and wet conditions using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)

The SPI analysis is following the training conducted in 28 Jan 2020 by [NASA ARSET](https://arset.gsfc.nasa.gov) on **Application of GPM IMERG Reanalysis for Assessing Extreme Dry and Wet Periods**. Link: https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/arset-applications-gpm-imerg-reanalysis-assessing-extreme-dry-and-wet

I will keep the old guideline (jupyter notebook and markdown files) in this repo although some steps might not work, and I have plan to revise it soon. In the meantime, use the new guideline.

**Follow the complete guideline here:**
