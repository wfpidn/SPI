    "- 1 month: Similar to a map displaying the percent of normal precipitation for a month. Reflects relatively short term conditions. Its application can be related closely with short term soil moisture and crop stress.\n",
    "- 3 month: Provides a comparison of the precipitation over a specific 3 month period with the precipitation totals from the same 3 month period for all the years included in the historical record. Reflects short and medium term moisture conditions and provides a seasonal estimation of precipitation.\n",
    "- 6 month: Compares the precipitation for that period with the same 6 month period over the historical record. A 6 month SPI can be very effective in showing the precipitation over distinct seasons and may be associated with anomalous streamflow and reservoir levels.\n",
    "- 9 month: Provides an indication of precipitation patterns over a medium time scale. SPI values below 1.5 for these time scales are usually a good indication that significant impacts are occurring in agriculture and may be showing up in other sectors as well.\n",
    "- 12 month: Reflects long term precipitation patterns. Longer SPIs tend toward zero unless a specific trend is taking place. SPIs of these time scales are probably tied to streamflow, reservoir levels, and even groundwater levels at the longer time scales. In some locations of the country, the 12 month SPI is most closely related with the Palmer Index, and the two indices should reflect similar conditions.\n",
